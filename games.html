                    <h3>The Generalissimo is Dead</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Generalissimo is Dead is a Megagame set in the chaos that follows the death of a strong, autocratic leader without any clear plan for succession.
                    </p>
                        <p>The game is set in the late 1980s, early 1990s.
                        </p>
                        <p>The modern era is firmly underway, the internet is here to stay and there has only been one superpower for quite some time.
                        </p>
                        <p>Yugenya has gone from being a forgotten backwater to the frontline of an economic cold war between China and the West due to the discovery of large rare earth metal mines. In the latter years of the Generalissimo’s life, he used the wealth from these mines to expand the revolutionary guard, build a navy and establish an air force.
                        </p>
                        <p>Critics would also say he channelled much of the wealth into paranoia-fuelled schemes against imagined foes. Regardless, Yugenya has never been so important.
                        </p>
                        <p>The loss of the guiding hand at this time is a crisis for all Party Members!

                    <h3>Den of Wolves</h3>
                    <p>It is the 27th Century and human society has spread to multiple planets. Despite political differences and internal problems, most of humanity is at peace. The various factions, spread across multiple star systems, are governed by the Interstellar Council.
                        <p />
                        This all changed eighteen days ago when the military of Wolf-1061, an insular and secretive planet-state, launched a massive, catastrophic attack against the other inhabited planets. Through a mixture of cyber-attacks, espionage and sabotage, they managed to disable the vast majority of the Interstellar Council's military, and went on to devastate their targets on the various planets.
                        <p />
                        Through the chaos, the battleship ICSS Aegis was able to survive the attack and escape to interstellar space. It soon found itself protecting and aiding numerous civilian vessels attempting to escape the Wolf forces. The "Survivor Fleet", as it has come to be known, must now provide critical resources for its survivors and vessels, whilst simultaneously trying to maintain government and social order, and mount an effective defence against pursuing Wolf forces.
                        <p />
                        Den of Wolves is a game about difficult political, military and survival choices in a long-term crisis scenario. Players will take on the roles of starship captains, officers, and engineers, as well as politicians and military personnel. The game has a focus on managing resources, as well as various units and assets – however, talking and negotiating with other players will be crucial in order to achieve success. The game also seeks to represent political and military systems, and their decisions, and so players should expect some political simulation.

                    <h3>Gods of the Ancient World</h3>
                    <p>
                        Whether you're leading troops across the Mediterranean, building a thriving empire, or shaping the destiny of mortals as a mighty god, Gods of the 
                        Ancient World offers an immersive experience like no other.<p>

                        Set during the height of the Roman and Greek civilizations, Gods of the Ancient World offers layers of strategy, negotiation, and world-building. 
                        Some players will manage resources, build industry, and manufacture fleets to sell artisanal goods to distant lands. Others will move troops throughout 
                        the Mediterranean and conquer regions for the glory of their faction. Still others will take on the roles of political leaders, developing laws for the 
                        betterment of their people whilst vying for their own political standings.<p>

                        Meanwhile, another group of players will assume the mantles of the ancient gods - Zeus, Poseidon, Hera, etc. - seeking the prayers of mortals to gain 
                        power to perform miracles and win influence over their rivals.
