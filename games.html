                    <h3>Gods of the Ancient World</h3>
                    <p><strong>Location:</strong> Rae Loft, Portland, OR</p>
                    <p>
                        Whether you're leading troops across the Mediterranean, building a thriving empire, or shaping the destiny of mortals as a mighty god, Gods of the 
                        Ancient World offers an immersive experience like no other.<p>

                        Set during the height of the Roman and Greek civilizations, Gods of the Ancient World offers layers of strategy, negotiation, and world-building. 
                        Some players will manage resources, build industry, and manufacture fleets to sell artisanal goods to distant lands. Others will move troops throughout 
                        the Mediterranean and conquer regions for the glory of their faction. Still others will take on the roles of political leaders, developing laws for the 
                        betterment of their people whilst vying for their own political standings.<p>

                        Meanwhile, another group of players will assume the mantles of the ancient gods - Zeus, Poseidon, Hera, etc. - seeking the prayers of mortals to gain 
                        power to perform miracles and win influence over their rivals.

                    <h3>Den of Wolves</h3>
                    <p>It is the 27th Century and human society has spread to multiple planets. Despite political differences and internal problems, most of humanity is at peace. The various factions, spread across multiple star systems, are governed by the Interstellar Council.
                        <p />
                        This all changed eighteen days ago when the military of Wolf-1061, an insular and secretive planet-state, launched a massive, catastrophic attack against the other inhabited planets. Through a mixture of cyber-attacks, espionage and sabotage, they managed to disable the vast majority of the Interstellar Council's military, and went on to devastate their targets on the various planets.
                        <p />
                        ​Through the chaos, the battleship ICSS Aegis was able to survive the attack and escape to interstellar space. It soon found itself protecting and aiding numerous civilian vessels attempting to escape the Wolf forces. The "Survivor Fleet", as it has come to be known, must now provide critical resources for its survivors and vessels, whilst simultaneously trying to maintain government and social order, and mount an effective defence against pursuing Wolf forces.
                        <p />
                        Den of Wolves is a game about difficult political, military and survival choices in a long-term crisis scenario. Players will take on the roles of starship captains, officers, and engineers, as well as politicians and military personnel. The game has a focus on managing resources, as well as various units and assets – however, talking and negotiating with other players will be crucial in order to achieve success. The game also seeks to represent political and military systems, and their decisions, and so players should expect some political simulation.
