                    <p>In this megagame, most players will take the role of either a Greek or a Roman, attempting to develop the largest, most impressive empire. Some players will be building up their home region by managing their resources, building industry, and manufacturing fleets to sell artisanal goods to distant lands. Other players will be moving troops around the Mediterranean and conquering regions for the glory of their faction. Others will be taking the role of political leaders, developing laws for the betterment of their people whilst vying for their own political standings. 
<p>
                        Meanwhile, a third faction of players will assume the mantle of the Ancient Gods - Zeus, Poseidon, Hera, etc. These players will be seeking to gain prayers from the mortals which will empower them to perform miracles and gain influence over their rivals.</p>

                    <h3>Den of Wolves</h3>
                    <p>It is the 27th Century and human society has spread to multiple planets. Despite political differences and internal problems, most of humanity is at peace. The various factions, spread across multiple star systems, are governed by the Interstellar Council.
                        <p />
                        This all changed eighteen days ago when the military of Wolf-1061, an insular and secretive planet-state, launched a massive, catastrophic attack against the other inhabited planets. Through a mixture of cyber-attacks, espionage and sabotage, they managed to disable the vast majority of the Interstellar Council's military, and went on to devastate their targets on the various planets.
                        <p />
                        ​Through the chaos, the battleship ICSS Aegis was able to survive the attack and escape to interstellar space. It soon found itself protecting and aiding numerous civilian vessels attempting to escape the Wolf forces. The "Survivor Fleet", as it has come to be known, must now provide critical resources for its survivors and vessels, whilst simultaneously trying to maintain government and social order, and mount an effective defence against pursuing Wolf forces.
                        <p />
                        Den of Wolves is a game about difficult political, military and survival choices in a long-term crisis scenario. Players will take on the roles of starship captains, officers, and engineers, as well as politicians and military personnel. The game has a focus on managing resources, as well as various units and assets – however, talking and negotiating with other players will be crucial in order to achieve success. The game also seeks to represent political and military systems, and their decisions, and so players should expect some political simulation.
