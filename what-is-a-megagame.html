                Megagames are notoriously difficult to define, but we'll give it a go…<br /><p />
                MegaGames are huge games with a bit of everything - role playing, combat mechanics, tech trees, bluffing, negotiation - but unlike most games they'’'re mostly driven by you, the player. The umpires, called the “Control Team,” will be on hand to answer questions and come up with rulings your creativity inspires. While you have agendas and goals laid out for you, megagames allow players to invent their own win conditions and pursue those as well.
                <p>Megagames are about the experience, NOT “winning”.

                Megagames tend to be:
                <ul>
                    <li>Between 25 and 75 players (although there are some that have reached 250!)</li>
                    <li>Approximately 6 hours long (but some might be as few as 2 hours)</li>
                    <li> Played in roles, not as a character (not always true)</li>
                    <li> Played in small teams (within the larger game)</li>
                    <li>Run on a Saturday (so you don';'t have to take time of work!)</li>
                    <li>Require an adjudicator/game master</li>
                    <li> Chaotic, but in a good way</li>
                    <li>Full of misinformation and miscommunication (also in a good way)</li>
                </ul>

                    <h3>Shut Up and Sit Down</h3>
                    The video that took megagames to the international stage. It's the video that got the Dukes of Highland into megagames and is well worth the watch. 
                    <p>
                    Essentially, the video is a playthrough of one of the most popular megagames, “Watch the Skies”.</p>

                    This video attempts to distill down what a megagame is in just 5 minutes. And we think they do a pretty decent job!
