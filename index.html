                        Crucible of Nations is a fast-paced geopolitical megagame set in a fantasy world. Teams negotiate, bluff, threaten, betray, or cooperate as they guide their nations through great upheaval. Achieve your national objective with diplomacy, war, and espionage. Whether you're a seasoned megagamer or new to the genre, Crucible of Nations has something for everyone.ï»¿

                        Civil war has shaken the Empire, creating a power vacuum unseen in centuries. Seven other nations grasp for power yet the imperial remnants refuse to bed. Will you lead your nation to glory, or witness its downfall?

                        For Portland Megagames' run of this title, we will be in the beautiful Rae Loft building in NE Portland. The game runs from 10am-5pm and there will be a 45 minute lunch break. There is plenty of food places nearby but you are welcome to bring your own lunch! Email details will be sent out, including a casting questionnaire asking about your preferences for teams and roles, as well as a team and role briefings and rules closer to the game itself. We are excited to host this and hope you'll join us!
                        <p>
                        We will be teaching the game at the beginning of the day and you won't need to bring anything. 
                        <p>
                        Costumes are encouraged but are by no means necessary.
                        <p>
                        There will be an after-game debrief/hangout at Migration Brewing for those who are interested.</p>
