                    <p><strong>Location:</strong> Gamestorm</p>
                    <p><strong>Date:</strong> Mar 19 - 22</p>
                            It is the 27th Century. After a catastrophic attack on humanity, one battleship and a few civilian vessels must fight to survive, govern themselves and maintain order as they flee from their 
                            pursuers. Den of Wolves: Infinite Domain is a game about difficult political, military and survival choices in a long-term crisis scenario. Players will take on the roles of starship captains, 
                            officers, and engineers, as well as politicians and military personnel. The game has a focus on managing resources, as well as various units and assets – however, talking and negotiating with other 
                            players will be crucial in order to achieve success. 
                            <p></p>
                            Infinite Domain is an expanded version of the classic Den of Wolves. Includes additional ships and roles, a new faction, as well as some streamlined rules and a graphical overhaul. 
                            Previous experience with Den of Wolves is not required to play.

                    <h3>March - Gamestorm - God Emperor</h3>
                    <p><strong>Location:</strong> Gamestorm</p>
                    <p><strong>Date:</strong> Mar 19 - 22</p>
                        God Emperor is a blood-stained fantasy Megagame of Power, Lies, and Regicide. 
                        <p></p>
                        Ten thousand years ago, The God Emperor and his infinite army came down from Heaven. In a single night they took over the continent, slew the demon who ruled here, and 
                        built Mount Leviathan from its bones. He has ruled with an iron fist ever since: Perfect, infallible, and eternal. You know this because everyone says so, in public. 
                        There's nothing to contradict it. He burnt all the history books.
                        <p></p>
                        Now, though, you hear the same people also whisper blasphemy: The God Emperor grows weak. He is seen little, and makes few decrees. Soldiers desert his armies. 
                        The old religions, almost forgotten now, are re-sprouting like trees after a fire.
                        <p></p>
                        You are a member of a Noble House. As the God Emperor rots, you have grown strong. Soon, this land will be yours. You will command armies. Make laws. Plot treason. 
                        <p></p>
                        You will become God.

                    <p>Whether you're leading troops across the Mediterranean, building a thriving empire, or shaping the destiny of mortals as a mighty god, Gods of the Ancient World offers an immersive experience like no other.

                        <p>
                        Set during the height of the Roman and Greek civilizations, Gods of the Ancient World offers layers of strategy, negotiation, and world-building. Some players will manage resources, build industry, and manufacture fleets to sell artisanal goods to distant lands. Others will move troops throughout the Mediterranean and conquer regions for the glory of their faction. Still others will take on the roles of political leaders, developing laws for the betterment of their people whilst vying for their own political standings.
                        <p>
                        Meanwhile, another group of players will assume the mantles of the ancient gods – Zeus, Poseidon, Hera, etc. – seeking the prayers of mortals to gain power to perform miracles and win influence over their rivals.
                        <p>
                        This game is perfect for players who enjoy complex strategy, role-playing, and the chance to immerse themselves in an ancient world where every decision has the potential to change history.
