                    <h3>Den of Wolves - March 22, 2025 @ 12 PM</h3>
                    <p><strong>Location:</strong> GameStorm PDX</p>
                    <p><strong>Date:</strong> March 22, 2025</p>
                    <p>
                    It is the 27th Century and human society has spread to multiple planets. Despite political differences and internal problems, most of humanity is at peace. The various factions, spread across multiple star systems, are governed by the Interstellar Council.
                    </p><p>
                    This all changed eighteen days ago when the military of Wolf-1061, an insular and secretive planet-state, launched a massive, catastrophic attack against the other inhabited planets. Through a mixture of cyber-attacks, espionage and sabotage, they managed to disable the vast majority of the Interstellar Council's military, and went on to devastate their targets on the various planets.
                    </p><p>
                    ​Through the chaos, the battleship ICSS Aegis was able to survive the attack and escape to interstellar space. It soon found itself protecting and aiding numerous civilian vessels attempting to escape the Wolf forces. The "Survivor Fleet", as it has come to be known, must now provide critical resources for its survivors and vessels, whilst simultaneously trying to maintain government and social order, and mount an effective defence against pursuing Wolf forces.
                    </p><p>
                    Den of Wolves is a game about difficult political, military and survival choices in a long-term crisis scenario. Players will take on the roles of starship captains, officers, and engineers, as well as politicians and military personnel. The game has a focus on managing resources, as well as various units and assets – however, talking and negotiating with other players will be crucial in order to achieve success. The game also seeks to represent political and military systems, and their decisions, and so players should expect some political simulation.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Custom Content Note: </strong> We will be adding some custom-designed content to this run depending on how many players show up so if you played Den of Wolves before, there will be some new twists to explore. </p>

                    Gamestorm is a smallish con (1500 attendees) that includes a big game library, a vendor hall, gaming space, hundreds of events and seminars you can sign up for (once their website opens for signups), 
                    and pretty much everything a bigger con has, just smol. Right now we are planning on running one session of Den of Wolves, with the possibility of doing more than one if the organizers are able to 
                    give us additional space and time. 
                </p><p>
                    The $60 badge fee is quite a bit more than what we've been charging for our standalone experiences, but you also get access to the full con. There is no additional ticket fee for the megagame, the con badge IS your ticket.
                     You will have to sign up on their website once signups go live in order to secure your spot. 
                     There may be opportunities for walkups depending on how much interest from y'all and from the wider gaming community there is and how many people end up no-showing. 
                     <p>Hope you'll consider joining us again!
                    </p>
