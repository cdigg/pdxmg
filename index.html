                    <p><strong>Location:</strong> Rae Loft PDX, Portland, OR</p>

                        The Generalissimo is Dead is a Megagame set in the chaos that follows the death of a strong, autocratic leader without any clear plan for succession.
                    </p>
                        <p>The game is set in the late 1980s, early 1990s.
                        </p>
                        <p>The modern era is firmly underway, the internet is here to stay and there has only been one superpower for quite some time.
                        </p>
                        <p>Yugenya has gone from being a forgotten backwater to the frontline of an economic cold war between China and the West due to the discovery of large rare earth metal mines. In the latter years of the Generalissimoâ€™s life, he used the wealth from these mines to expand the revolutionary guard, build a navy and establish an air force.
                        </p>
                        <p>Critics would also say he channelled much of the wealth into paranoia-fuelled schemes against imagined foes. Regardless, Yugenya has never been so important.
                        </p>
                        <p>The loss of the guiding hand at this time is a crisis for all Party Members!
