                    <p><strong>Location:</strong> Rae Loft, Portland, OR</p>

                    <p>Whether you're leading troops across the Mediterranean, building a thriving empire, or shaping the destiny of mortals as a mighty god, Gods of the Ancient World offers an immersive experience like no other.

                        <p>
                        Set during the height of the Roman and Greek civilizations, Gods of the Ancient World offers layers of strategy, negotiation, and world-building. Some players will manage resources, build industry, and manufacture fleets to sell artisanal goods to distant lands. Others will move troops throughout the Mediterranean and conquer regions for the glory of their faction. Still others will take on the roles of political leaders, developing laws for the betterment of their people whilst vying for their own political standings.
                        <p>
                        Meanwhile, another group of players will assume the mantles of the ancient gods – Zeus, Poseidon, Hera, etc. – seeking the prayers of mortals to gain power to perform miracles and win influence over their rivals.
                        <p>
                        This game is perfect for players who enjoy complex strategy, role-playing, and the chance to immerse themselves in an ancient world where every decision has the potential to change history. Get your tickets today!

There is plenty of food places nearby but you are welcome to bring your own lunch!

We are excited to host this and hope you'll join us!
