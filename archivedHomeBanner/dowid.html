    <h3>Den of Wolves: Infinite Domain, Oct 19 2025 @ 10 AM</h3>
    <p><strong>Location:</strong> Vault 31, Vancouver, WA</p>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> Oct 19, 2025</p>
        It is the 27th Century. After a catastrophic attack on humanity, one battleship and a few civilian vessels must fight to survive, govern themselves and maintain order as they flee from their 
        pursuers. Den of Wolves: Infinite Domain is a game about difficult political, military and survival choices in a long-term crisis scenario. Players will take on the roles of starship captains, 
        officers, and engineers, as well as politicians and military personnel. The game has a focus on managing resources, as well as various units and assets â€“ however, talking and negotiating with other 
        players will be crucial in order to achieve success. 
        <p></p>
        Infinite Domain is an expanded version of the classic Den of Wolves. Includes additional ships and roles, a new faction, as well as some streamlined rules and a graphical overhaul. 
        Previous experience with Den of Wolves is not required to play.
