                        Come to Deephaven! A narrative megagame about overly-ambitious dwarves building a new city fortress. Players will delve deep into the mountain to 
                        discover unique resources, forge legendary weapons, develop thriving trade and culture, and fight back against the many dangers they uncover!
                        <p>
                        All Dwarves are welcome at Deephaven! From the proud Mountain clans and industrious Hill clans, to the mysterious clans of the Deep. Yes, even 
                        Gully Dwarves are allowed! MINERS delve deep to find arcane metals! SHAPERS forge legendary weapons, armor, and new inventions. ARCHITECTS build 
                        awe-inspiring structures and massive fortifications. MERCHANTS handle foreign trade, FARMERS feed us, and BREWERS keep us, uh, well-hydrated! The 
                        CARTOGRAPHERS maintain the Grand Map and the INKBEARDS chronicle discoveries, announce oaths, grudges, and important events. The GUARDIANS keep the 
                        peace, and the LEGION leads us to war! Come to Deephaven! Build a new home for all Dwarves!

                        For Portland Megagames' run of this title, we will be in the beautiful Rae Loft building in NE Portland. The game runs from 10am-5pm and there will be a 45 
                        minute lunch break. There are plenty of food places nearby but you are welcome to bring your own lunch.
                        Email details will be sent out, including a casting questionnaire asking about your preferences for teams and roles, as well as a team and 
                        role briefings and rules closer to the game itself. We are excited to host this and hope you'll join us!
                        <p>
                        We will be teaching the game at the beginning of the day and you won't need to bring anything. 
                        <p>
